    "Imitation Learning (IL) is a set of techniques aimed at training a model to directly mimic an expert's actions from a collection of demonstrations. In this practical, we focus on **offline imitation learning**, meaning we assume there exists a dataset consisting of demonstration data in which each sample correspond to a state-action pair collected from the expert. In practice, this might mean collecting keystrokes of a human player on an Atari game, controls of a human-driven car, or medical decisions of a doctor along a course of treatment. In this case, the goal of an IL algorithm is to learn a policy (i.e., a full mapping from states to actions) that mimics the expert policy (for which you only have a set of observations)."

    "* `[fc1]` represents the first fully connected layer with 64 neurons.\n",
    "* `[ReLU]` represents the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function applied after each fully connected layer.\n",
    "* `[fc2]` represents the second fully connected layer with 64 neurons.\n",
    "* `[fc3]` represents the third fully connected layer, which outputs the mapping from states to deterministic actions. The number of neurons in this layer is determined by action_dim.\n",

    "The arrows between layers represent the connections and transformations of data as it flows through the network during forward pass. The ReLU activation functions introduce non-linearity in the model.\n",
